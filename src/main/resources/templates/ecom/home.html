            <p>E-COM services began on January 4, 1982, and the original rates were 26 cents for the first page plus 2
            cents for the second page for each transmission. In addition, there was an annual fee of $50 for the
            service. During its inaugural year of service, 3.2 million E-COM messages were sent, and more than 600
            customers submitted applications for the service. Federal law prohibits the USPS from subsidizing a mail
            class by overcharging the users of other mail classes; however, E-COM was heavily subsidized from its
            introduction. During its first year of operation, the USPS lost $5.25 per letter. The House Government
            Operations Committee indicated that "The Postal Service deliberately manipulates the release of information
            about E-COM in order to make E-COM appear to be more successful than it really is."</p>
